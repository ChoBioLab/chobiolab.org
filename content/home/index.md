      - title: About the Cho Lab
        content: 'The Cho Laboratory investigates the genetic and immunologic factors associated with Crohnâ€™s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis, collectively known as Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD). We are working on further identifying rare disease associated variants in Ashkenazi Jewish population by Exome Chip technology as well as the biological function of those identified genes. Dr. Choâ€™s research has contributed to defining the pathophysiologic mechanisms of IBD by identifying associations to NOD2, IL23R, and 163 loci to IBD. With new findings our research is evolving to now looking at the function of lipid mediators and their related cytokines in innate immune cells, and the full transcriptome of enteroids, the intestinal epithelial stem cells.'
