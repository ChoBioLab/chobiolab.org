abstract: Genome-wide association studies in Crohn's disease (CD) have identified
  140 genome-wide significant loci. However, identification of genes driving association
  signals remains challenging. Furthermore, genome-wide significant thresholds limit
  false positives at the expense of decreased sensitivity. In this study, we explored
  gene features contributing to CD pathogenicity, including gene-based association
  data from CD and autoimmune (AI) diseases, as well as gene expression features (eQTLs,
  epigenetic markers of expression and intestinal gene expression data). We developed
  an integrative model based on a CD reference gene set. This integrative approach
  outperformed gene-based association signals alone in identifying CD-related genes
  based on statistical validation, gene ontology enrichment, differential expression
  between M1 and M2 macrophages and a validation using genes causing monogenic forms
  of inflammatory bowel disease as a reference. Besides gene-level CD association
  P-values, association with AI diseases was the strongest predictor, highlighting
  generalized mechanisms of inflammation, and the interferon-Î³ pathway particularly.
  Within the 140 high-confidence CD regions, 598 of 1328 genes had low prioritization
  scores, highlighting genes unlikely to contribute to CD pathogenesis. For select
  regions, comparably high integrative model scores were observed for multiple genes.
  This is particularly evident for regions having extensive linkage disequilibrium
  such as the IBD5 locus. Our analyses provide a standardized reference for prioritizing
  potential CD-related genes, in regions with both highly significant and nominally
  significant gene-level association P-values. Our integrative model may be particularly
  valuable in prioritizing rare, potentially private, missense variants for which
  genome-wide evidence for association may be unattainable.
