abstract: Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory intestinal disease that is frequently
  accompanied by aberrant healing and stricturing complications. Crosstalk between
  activated myeloid and stromal cells is critical in the pathogenicity of Crohn's
  disease1,2, and increases in intravasating monocytes are correlated with a lack
  of response to anti-TNF treatment3. The risk alleles with the highest effect on
  Crohn's disease are loss-of-function mutations in NOD24,5, which increase the risk
  of stricturing6. However, the mechanisms that underlie pathogenicity driven by NOD2
  mutations and the pathways that might rescue a lack of response to anti-TNF treatment
  remain largely uncharacterized. Here we use direct ex vivo analyses of patients
  who carry risk alleles of NOD2 to show that loss of NOD2 leads to dysregulated homeostasis
  of activated fibroblasts and macrophages. CD14+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells
  from carriers of NOD2 risk alleles produce cells that express high levels of collagen,
  and elevation of conserved signatures is observed in nod2-deficient zebrafish models
  of intestinal injury. The enrichment of STAT3 regulation and gp130 ligands in activated
  fibroblasts and macrophages suggested that gp130 blockade might rescue the activated
  program in NOD2-deficient cells. We show that post-treatment induction of the STAT3
  pathway is correlated with a lack of response to anti-TNF treatment in patients,
  and demonstrate in vivo in zebrafish the amelioration of the activated myeloid-stromal
  niche using the specific gp130 inhibitor bazedoxifene. Our results provide insights
  into NOD2-driven fibrosis in Crohn's disease, and suggest that gp130 blockade may
  benefit some patients with Crohn's disease-potentially as a complement to anti-TNF
  therapy.
