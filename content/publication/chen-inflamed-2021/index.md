abstract: 'BACKGROUND & AIMS: Recent literature has implicated a key role for mast
  cells in murine models of colonic inflammation, but their role in human ulcerative
  colitis (UC) is not well established. A major advance has been the identification
  of mrgprb2 (human orthologue, MRGPX2) as mediating IgE-independent mast cell activation.
  We sought to define mechanisms of mast cell activation and MRGPRX2 in human UC.
  METHODS: Colon tissues were collected from patients with UC for bulk RNA sequencing
  and lamina propria cells were isolated for MRGPRX2 activation studies and single-cell
  RNA sequencing. Genetic association of all protein-altering G-protein coupled receptor
  single-nucleotide polymorphism was performed in an Ashkenazi Jewish UC case-control
  cohort. Variants of MRGPRX2 were transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and
  human mast cell (HMC) 1.1 cells to detect genotype-dependent effects on β-arrestin
  recruitment, IP-1 accumulation, and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated
  kinase. RESULTS: Mast cell-specific mediators and adrenomedullin (proteolytic precursor
  of PAMP-12, an MRGPRX2 agonist) are up-regulated in inflamed compared to uninflamed
  UC. MRGPRX2 stimulation induces carboxypeptidase secretion from inflamed UC. Of
  all protein-altering GPCR alleles, a unique variant of MRGPRX2, Asn62Ser, was most
  associated with and was bioinformatically predicted to alter arrestin recruitment.
  We validated that the UC protective serine allele enhances β-arrestin recruitment,
  decreases IP-1, and increases phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase
  with MRGPRX2 agonists. Single-cell RNA sequencing defines that adrenomedullin is
  expressed by activated fibroblasts and epithelial cells and that interferon gamma
  is a key upstream regulator of mast cell gene expression. CONCLUSION: Inflamed UC
  regions are distinguished by MRGPRX2-mediated activation of mast cells, with decreased
  activation observed with a UC-protective genetic variant. These results define cell
  modules of UC activation and a new therapeutic target.'
