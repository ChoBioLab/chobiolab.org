abstract: "BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease complicated by perianal fistulae is more prevalent\
  \ and severe in patients of African ancestry. METHODS: We profiled single cells\
  \ from diverse patients with Crohn's disease with perianal fistula from colorectal\
  \ mucosa and fistulous tracts. Immunofluorescence was performed to validate predicted\
  \ cell-cell interactions. Unstimulated monocytes were chronically cultured in diverse\
  \ cohorts. A subset was analyzed by single-nucleus RNA + ATAC sequencing. FINDINGS:\
  \ Fistulous tract cells from complete proctectomies demonstrated enrichment of myeloid\
  \ cells compared to paired rectal tissues. Ligand-receptor analysis highlights myeloid-stromal\
  \ cross-talk and cellular senescence, with cellular co-localization validated by\
  \ immunofluorescence. Chitinase-3 like-protein-1 (CHI3L1) is a top upregulated gene\
  \ in stromal cells from fistulae expressing both destructive and fibrotic gene signatures.\
  \ Monocyte cultures from patients of African ancestry and controls demonstrated\
  \ differences in CHI3L1 and oncostatin M (OSM) expression upon differentiation compared\
  \ to individuals of European ancestry. Activating protein-1 footprints are present\
  \ in ATAC-seq peaks in stress response genes, including CHI3L1 and OSM; genome-wide\
  \ chromatin accessibility including JUN footprints was observed, consistent with\
  \ reported mechanisms of inflammatory memory. Regulon analyses confirm known cell-specific\
  \ transcription factor regulation and implicate novel ones in fibroblast subsets.\
  \ All pseudo-bulked clusters demonstrate enrichment of genetic loci, establishing\
  \ multicellular contributions. In the most significant African American Crohn's\
  \ genetic locus, upstream of prostaglandin E receptor 4, lymphoid-predominant ATAC-seq\
  \ peaks were observed, with predicted RORC footprints. CONCLUSIONS: Population differences\
  \ in myeloid-stromal cross-talk implicate fibrotic and destructive fibroblasts,\
  \ senescence, epigenetic memory, and cell-specific enhancers in perianal fistula\
  \ pathogenesis. The transcriptomic and epigenetic data provided here may guide optimization\
  \ of promising mesenchymal stem cell therapies for perianal fistula. FUNDING: This\
  \ work was supported by grants U01DK062422, U24DK062429, and R01DK123758."
